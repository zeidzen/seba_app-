Congratulations on deciding to learn Arabic!

Arabic is a challenging language to learn, “Sibawayh” makes it easier. 

Sibawayh offers you the gift of easy and fun learning, no matter where you are from or what language you speak. It has many levels , each level has many lessons , with a lot of practice questions and exercises. When you pass a certain level, you get a certificate that qualifies you to move to the next level, that if you pass the test of course. 
Not all of Sibawayh is free, you would have to pay to enjoy “ the dictionary”, and of course , to pass the last level ! 
Good luck
